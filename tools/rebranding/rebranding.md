Rebranding allows partners to redistribute Paracraft with their own logos. 
Please see each folder for examples of rebranding. 

## How to rebrand (White Label)
Basically in the example folder, you edit `rebranding.txt` and run `Run.bat` to test. 

## Deployment
Once satisfied, just copy `rebranding.txt` and any referenced png files to the `./redist` directory to finish installation. 

To generate installer, one needs to: 
* download a tool called nsis from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/>
* edit `*.nsi` file and replace any text you like
* compile it with nsis to generate your installer.
