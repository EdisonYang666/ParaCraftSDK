---+ LICENSE for NPL/ParaEngine/Paracraft

Version 1.0 Date: 2015.3.19

Below are three license files for NPL, ParaEngine and Paracraft(SDK).
Our software is not completely open sourced, the reason is that we want to make sure that all toolset and code is modular and functional by the time they are open sourced. We are working hard to make all of them open sourced under GPL license. Commercial license is possible by contacting the author. 

---++ Logics Behind
We have chosen GPL as the base license for all ParaEngine related software. NPL is special and is LGPL based. Our mission is to make the software modular and functional and fully open sourced. Our best wish is that more and more developers can use our software and NPL without worries, and more and more people and companies are willing to contribute to its code base. 

Paracraft and ParaEngine should become a high quality framework of many free and open sourced tools and algorithms. I believe that license like unreal and unity is wrong. The 5% of total venue from developers should not be our primary income, but rather a way to prevent bad competitions with our own software. The content of Paracraft is our primary future income. This is why the use of ParaEngine is free even for commercial use, while paracraft SDK charges you 5% of total venue if used commercially.

免费修改，发布，商业化，但要在代码中保留License内容，不可声称原创. 

NPL采用和LGPL兼容的协议：
	LGPL的全称是 GNU Lesser General Public License，GNU 较宽松公共许可证，也是由协议是由自由软体基金会发布的许可证，是一个主要为类库使用设计的开源协议，和GPL要求任何使用/修改/衍生之GPL类库的的软件必须采用GPL协议不同。LGPL允许商业软件通过类库引用(link)方式使用LGPL类库而不需要开源商业软件的代码。这使得采用LGPL协议的开源代码可以被商业软件作为类库引用并发布和销售。
